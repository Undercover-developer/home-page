            <h2>What Is an Agent?</h2>
            <p>
                Before discussing multi-agent systems, we must first answer a deceptively simple question:
                <strong>what is an agent?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In classical artificial intelligence, an <em>agent</em> is an entity that
                <strong>perceives its environment through sensors</strong> and
                <strong>acts upon that environment through actuators</strong>.
                This definition, popularized by Russell and Norvig, emphasizes interaction, autonomy,
                and decision-making under uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Importantly, an agent is not defined by its internal implementation.
                It may be rule-based, learning-based, symbolic, or statistical.
                What matters is that it continuously participates in a
                <em>perception–decision–action loop</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>Agents in the Age of LLM(s)</h2>
            <p>
                In today’s AI ecosystem, the term <em>agent</em> is frequently applied to systems that
                are little more than scripted workflows around large language models.
                A typical example involves an LLM calling tools, executing steps in sequence,
                and returning a final response.
            </p>
            <p>
                While such systems may be useful, they differ fundamentally from agents as defined in
                the AI literature. Most lack:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent autonomy</li>
                <li>Independent control loops</li>
                <li>Direct interaction with an evolving environment</li>
                <li>Robust real-time decision-making</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Calling these systems “agents” is often a matter of convenience or marketing,
                rather than a reflection of their underlying architecture.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is an Intelligent Agent?</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>intelligent agent</strong> is not merely reactive.
                It selects actions that maximize expected performance relative to a goal or utility function.
                Intelligence, in this sense, refers to <em>rational behavior</em>,
                not human-like cognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intelligent agents typically exhibit:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> sensing and interpreting environmental signals</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> selecting actions under uncertainty</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> improving behavior over time</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-directedness:</strong> acting toward explicit objectives</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Makes a System Multi-Agent?</h2>
            <p>
                A system is considered a <strong>multi-agent system (MAS)</strong> when it is composed
                of multiple intelligent agents that interact within a shared environment.
                Crucially, this interaction may be cooperative, competitive, or mixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, not all systems with multiple components qualify as true MAS.
                The defining property is <strong>decentralization</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Decentralization as a First-Class Requirement</h3>
            <p>
                In a genuine multi-agent system, no single agent possesses global control.
                Each agent operates based on local information, communicates with peers,
                and coordinates behavior without relying on a central orchestrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a system collapses control into a single coordinating entity,
                it effectively becomes a monolithic or hierarchical system,
                even if it contains many subcomponents.
            </p>

            <h3>Most “Multi-Agent” Systems Are Pipelines</h3>
            <p>
                Many modern systems labeled as multi-agent are better described as
                <strong>pipelines or workflows</strong>.
                These systems decompose tasks into steps and execute them sequentially
                under centralized control.
            </p>

            <table class="col-1-l col-2-c borderless">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>

                    </tr>

                        <td>Adaptation</td>
                        <td>Continuous and distributed</td>
                        <td>Limited or manual</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Core Capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
            <p>
                For a system to meaningfully qualify as multi-agent, it must support
                several core capabilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time decision-making:</strong> agents respond continuously to changes</li>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> agents observe the environment independently</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> agents exchange information via protocols</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> agents resolve conflicts and align actions</li>
                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> agents reason over future states and strategies</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Multi-agent systems are not a recent invention, nor are they synonymous
                with modern “agentic” AI tooling.
                They represent a deep and rigorous field focused on decentralized intelligence,
                coordination, and emergent behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                As interest in agent-based systems continues to grow,
                maintaining conceptual clarity is essential.
                Not every workflow is a multi-agent system,
                and not every tool-calling LLM is an agent.
            </p>
